# PTIT - Operating Systems Assignment  
This repository contains implementations of two key concepts in Operating Systems: Sleeping Barber Problem & FIFO

## Overview  
1. **Sleeping Barber Problem**:  
   - Implemented in [`BarberShop.java`](https://github.com/trandinhhao/PTIT-HDH-SleepingBarberProblem-and-FIFO/blob/main/SourceCode/BarberShop.java).  
   - A classic synchronization problem that models the interactions between a barber, customers, and waiting chairs.  
   - Demonstrates the use of threads and semaphores for managing shared resources.  

2. **FIFO (First In, First Out)**:  
   - Implemented in [`FIFO19.java`](https://github.com/trandinhhao/PTIT-HDH-SleepingBarberProblem-and-FIFO/blob/main/SourceCode/FIFO19.java).  
   - A fundamental scheduling algorithm where the first process to arrive is the first to be served.  
   - Useful in understanding process and resource management in operating systems.
